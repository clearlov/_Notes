SCTP provides associations, sequencing, flow control and full-duplex[Ëˆdu:pleks] data transfer.
|[
Connection: involves communication between only two IP addresses
Association: refers to a communication between two systems, which may involve more than two addresses due to multi-homing.

TCP is half-close. Any part can send a FIN to terminate connection. But it can 
still receive data after sending a FIN.
