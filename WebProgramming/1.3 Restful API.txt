|- 405 when transfer by PUT/PATCH/DELETE/OPTION -|
You need to transfer to the full path with `index.php`. For example,
`curl -i -X PUT 'http://www.luexu.com/'` displays 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED error. 
Meanwhile, `curl -i -X PUT 'http://www.luexu.com/index.php'` runs well
So you'd better add `rewrite ^(.*)/$	$1/index.php last;
