How to learn web architecture from A to Z?

Why I always ask some programmers how to be a web architect? Because I think this job is cool. But I learnt so much Javascript/HTML/CSS/Photoshop, I found that I know nothing about architecture. I walked on the wrong way before. So I asked for over a half year. I asked BD basic architecture programmers and them who work for `architecture`. I found it's a little bit different. So I asked two funny and famous PHP programmers. It doesn't mean that I would be an architect
. But I think it's useful for both of us to learn PHP in the right way. If you want to be an web architect, please work in a firm that holds more than 500 programmers by any means (Said Demon). Otherwise, just learn it for fun (My purpose).
==> Txs to Demon(Super Senior PHPer, He only said `Learn well basic knowledge and worked in a company that more than 500 staffs. ==> I asked, what's the hell basic knowledge? He replied: Just the basic knowledge....  Okay, I think he said something I can agree more.`),

1. 	LNMP   ==> e.g. Logs, fastcgi/fastcgi_pass access_log   InnoDB/MyISAM
				Yaf / Yii / Laravel
		Q: Why Nginx works better than Apache?
		Q: Configures multicore Nginx, events, proxy_pass, sendfile/tcp_*
		Q: What's Overtime and its affection?
		Q: Configures Proxy and Reverse Static Server
		Q: Configures for innodb/myisam (e.g. key_bufer/query_cache/sort_buffer/innodb_buffer_pool_size/innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit/innodb_log_buffer_size/back_log/table_open_cache/thread_cache_size/innodb_lock_wait_timeout)
		Q: What's `show status/profile` in MySQL
		Q: MySQL backup (Binlog, Multi-IDC, Cold/Hot Backup)
		Q: Master and Slave Database (binlog_format  slow_log/explain/index)
		Q: What is PHP OOP(Abstract Factory, Viewer, Singleton, Observer, CommandChain, Responsibility Chain, Adapter), SPL, MVC
		Q: How to use mod_php/fastcgi/PHP-FPM, and how to calculate the number of process for them? 
		Q: What's Data Drift?
2. 	HTML: YSlow / Page Speed
	Web Serv: 
		Apache AB  => 
		http_load  => throughout capability and load (Linux Only)
		LoadRunner => imitate millions or billions users run simultaneously
	PHP: Xdebug xhprof
    C:  Valgrind Callgrind
    MySQL: 	---> query log analysis
			mysqlsla => slow query log
			mk-query-digest  => query log
		
			innotop  => real time watch in servers
			sysbench => performance of different hardware and OS and MySQL
			mysqladmin => MySQL performance counters increment and Server run status
			vmstat => system loads
			drtace => system level performance analyses
			
			mpstat => CPU usage
			oprofile => where inside MySQL or Kernel CPU time is spent
			filefrag => fragmentation of the file
			fincore => watchs the given file is cached in OS cache
			iostat => IO problems
			iohist => IO response time
			
			mk-table-checksum  => useful for Data Drift
			
			tcprstat  => monitors TCP requests, statistics about low-level response times
			mysqldumper => backup  ==> like mysqldump 
			xtrabackup  => every day using data nonblocking backup
			
3.  Deep understanding about HTML Protocol: 
	HTTP Status and the reasons 
	    Q: what's the difference between the changes of Cache-Control/Expires in http status 302?
		Q: 502 indicates Bad Gateway, normally the invalid from PHP(not Nginx)

4. 	Linux  ==> e.g. shell, awk/sed/watch/tcpdump/starce/ldd/ar/perl

5. 	Cache/NoSQL  ==> Redis/Memcached, MongoDB
6.	protobuf/thrift
7. 	Zend Engine and extends PHP with C. e.g. zval/hashtable/gc
8. 	Extends Nginx + Lua
9. 	B-Tree/rb-tree/skiplist/lsm-tree/trie-tree, multi-process/multi-thread programming
10. Destructs Chinese Words / machine learning skills  ===> Damn it! Are you kidding me?
