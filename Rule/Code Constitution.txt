|+ Use prefix form (++i/--i) rather than (i++/i--) in loop +|
|[
int rear;
for(rear = 0; bool, ++i); 
]|
|- Pros -|
In PHP and C++, when the return value is ignored, (++i/--i) is more efficient.
This is because (i++) requires a copy of i to be made. Especially it's an iterator.
|+ Declaration Order: variables, methods; private, protected, public +|
Use the specified order of declarations within a class: private protected public; data members (variables) before methods.
|- Pros -|
It's accepted in Facebook and it's more human readable.
|- Cons -|
It's contrary to Google C++ Guider "Declaration Order".
